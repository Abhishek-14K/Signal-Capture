# Signal-Capture

The STM32L476RG is to be used to capture a signal generated by the signal generators. It should capture 1000 measurements ranging in microseconds and those values are to be listed in ascending order of how many times they occurred.
At the very start of the program, a Power on Self Test is to be administered where, the MCU performs a check on startup. If there is no input detected within the first 100 milliseconds, the test fails and the user should be given an option to repeat. Once the input is detected, the user interface is to be activated.
In the user interface, the user is to allowed to select the limits for the measurements based on the input signal. Once the measurements are displayed, the user should be given a chance to repeat this process.
